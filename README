Requires:
Python 2.5 or 2.6
wxpython (http://www.wxpython.org/)
py-editdist (http://www.mindrot.org/projects/py-editdist/)

The program works like this:
1. Loop through selected songs in iTunes
2. Generate permutations of the title/artist, for example removing parentheses in the title, or splitting titles like "artist - title" into the artist and title fields
3. Look up the permutations in the iTunes store until it finds a match within 3s of the correct track duration
4. Pick the best match based on the artist similarity, title similarity, and earliest year
5. Back up the track info
6. Replace the track info with the new info

If it can't find a matching track in the iTunes store, it just skips it.
